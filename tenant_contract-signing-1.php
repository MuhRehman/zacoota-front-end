                                <p><span>12.1.</span> If and whenever during the Term:</p>
                                <ul>

                                <p><span>15.3.</span>This Guarantee is irrevocable and shall continue beyond the Guarantor’s death or bankruptcy (falling as a

                                    on written demand the Guarantor hereby agrees to pay damages to the Landlord for all losses, claims, liabilities,
                                    costs and expenses arising out of or in connection with that default or disclaimer or incurred by the Landlord in

                                <p><span>15.5.</span> It is hereby agreed that the Guarantor’s liability under this Clause will be joint and several with the Tenant
                                    which means that each will be responsible for complying with the Tenant’s obligations under this agreement both
                                    individually and together. The Landlord may seek to enforce these obligations and claim damages against the
                                    Tenant, the Guarantor, or both of them under these clauses. These obligations will not be cleared or affected by
                                    any act, neglect, leniency, or giving of time by the Landlord endeavouring to obtain payment or in the
                                    enforcement of the Tenant’s covenants. If the Tenant surrenders any part of the Premises the Guarantor’s
                                    liability will continue in respect of the part not surrendered. Any liability accumulated at the date of surrender will
                                    continue unaffected.
                                </p>
                                <p><span>15.6.</span> If requested by the Landlord, the Guarantor agrees to provide written confirmation of their current address
                                    at the start of the tenancy and to notify the Landlord in writing if they move to a new address in the course of the
